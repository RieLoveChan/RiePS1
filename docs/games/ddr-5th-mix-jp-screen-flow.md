# Dispatcher

`FUN_80022cf8` (`0x80022cf8`), called once per iteration of `main`'s
per-frame loop. Reads a 16-bit "mode" field at `PTR_DAT_800ac8e8+0x28`;
`mode == 2` and the unmatched-mode default both additionally read a 16-bit
"submode" field at `PTR_DAT_800ac8e8+0x2a`. Full structural review:
`/docs/games/ddr-5th-mix-jp-symbol-map.md`, "Manual review: `FUN_80022cf8`".

# Fill-in instructions

Add your hypothesis in **Proposed screen**, set **`confidence`** to
`suspected`, and explain your reasoning (what about DDR/StepMania's typical
flow suggests this) in **Notes** — per
[/docs/foundations/screen-flow-schema.md](/docs/foundations/screen-flow-schema.md).
Leave `Evidence` blank; that gets filled in once someone (human or agent)
reads the handler's own code and confirms or refutes the guess. Don't
worry about being wrong — a rejected guess with its reasoning recorded is
still useful; it rules something out.

# Mode table

| Mode | Submode | Handler(s) | Structural facts | Proposed screen | `confidence` | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x00` | — | `FUN_80023048` (132 B) | Single call, no args observed. | | `unverified` | | |
| `0x02` | `0x00` | `FUN_8009f820(0x280, 0x1e0)` then `FUN_800231b0` (32 B) | Args `0x280`/`0x1e0` = 640/480 — screen-dimension-shaped; likely a full-screen clear, then a second call. | | `unverified` | | |
| `0x02` | `0x01` | `FUN_8009f390` (100 B), conditionally `FUN_800231b0` (32 B) if result `> 0` | `FUN_800231b0` is shared with submode `0x00` above — possibly a common "commit/present" step. | | `unverified` | | |
| `0x02` | `0x02` | `FUN_80049dec` (280 B) | Single call, no args observed. | | `unverified` | | |
| `0x04` | — | `FUN_800230cc` (112 B) | Single call, no args observed. | | `unverified` | | |
| `0x10` | `0x00` (default-branch) | `FUN_800232cc` (168 B) | Mode `0x10` skips straight to the same default-branch submode check every unmatched mode uses (see "Default" row). | | `unverified` | | |
| `0x10` | `0x01` (default-branch) | `FUN_80022b30` (456 B) | Largest handler seen so far. | | `unverified` | | |
| `0x20` | — | `FUN_800219b8` (60 B) | Single call, no args observed. | | `unverified` | | |
| `0x32` | — | `FUN_80021a30` (60 B) | Single call, no args observed. | | `unverified` | | |
| `0x80` | — | *(none)* | No handler call at all — just sets `PTR_DAT_800ac8ec[0] = 0` then falls to the shared epilogue. Possibly a "clear/idle" mode rather than a screen. | | `unverified` | | |
| `0xff` | — | `FUN_80022fb0` (152 B) | Single call, no args observed. `0xff` is a common sentinel ("uninitialized"/"none") value in many codebases — worth keeping in mind as an alternative to "it's a real screen." | | `unverified` | | |
| *(default)* | `0x00` | `FUN_800232cc` (168 B) | Reached when `mode` matches none of the above (or `mode == 0x10` explicitly). Same handler as `0x10`/submode `0x00` above. | | `unverified` | | |
| *(default)* | `0x01` | `FUN_80022b30` (456 B) | Same handler as `0x10`/submode `0x01` above. | | `unverified` | | |

Every row also runs the shared per-frame epilogue after its handler:
`FUN_80023744` (476 B), `FUN_8009971c` (84 B), and conditionally
`FUN_80023210(0x80)` (32 B) if `PTR_DAT_800ac8ec[7] != 0`. Not included as
separate rows since it isn't mode-specific.

# Open structural questions

- Is `PTR_DAT_800ac8e8+0x28` ever written anywhere other than by
  `FUN_8002216c`'s zero-reset (which sets the whole struct, including this
  field, to `0`)? Finding every write site would recover valid mode values
  and the transitions between them directly, independent of guessing from
  genre knowledge.
- Why do `0x10` (explicit) and "no match" reach the exact same
  submode-`0x2a` dispatch? Possibilities: `0x10` is not really a distinct
  mode but an alias/placeholder, or the default branch is intentionally
  shared infrastructure that `0x10` also happens to want.
